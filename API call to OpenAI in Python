Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key. Also, note that this example uses the text-davinci-codex model, but you can choose a different model based on your requirements.

When you run the code, it will make an API call to OpenAI, passing your code as a prompt, and retrieve the optimal code suggestion from the API response. The optimal code will be printed to the console.

Remember to use the OpenAI API responsibly and in accordance with their terms of service.
